# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

This repo summarizes what I have learned in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. The index includes links to the many exercises and projects that were part of this program.

## Projects and Execises ordered by Topic

## Introduction
As an introduction we were given

### Some examples of what deep learning is capable of: 
1. Transfering an artist's styles to your own fotographs: [**Fast Style Transfer**](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer)
2. Learning to steer a car: [**Deep Traffic**](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/)
3. Learning to play flappybird: [**DeepLearningFlappyBird**](https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird)

### Literature
4. [Literature on Deep Learning](docs/literature.md)

### Tools
5. [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) is the main tool for deep learning, packages are installed with `conda install <package>`


## NN: Regular Neural Networks

## CNNs

## Project2: Dog breed recognising app build with a pretrained CNN
In this project we used pretrained CNNs to build an app that could distinguish dogs and humans and predict the breed for dogs.

# RNNS

## Project3: Generate a TV script with an RNN
In this projects an RNN predicted the next word. It was trained on TV scripts of the Simpsons.
It uses LSTMs

# GANs
GANs are Generative Adverserial Networks. In these networks two players: a discriminator and a generator are trained in parallel with opposite goals: the generator wants to produce fakes, that go through as real and the discrimnator wants to detect fakes and reject them. The overall goal is to improve both player, where the focus might be on either of them. 

## Exercise 1: MNIST with a GAN
In this exercise a Gan was build to create fake handwritten digits:
- this is a small project, that does not take much time to train and you can none the less watch how a GAN works and trains
