## Projects and Execises ordered by Topic

## NN: Regular Neural Networks

## CNNs

## Project2: Dog breed recognising app build with a pretrained CNN
In this project we used pretrained CNNs to build an app that could distinguish dogs and humans and predict the breed for dogs.

# RNNS

## Project3: Generate a TV script with an RNN
In this projects an RNN predicted the next word. It was trained on TV scripts of the Simpsons.
It uses LSTMs

# GANs
GANs are Generative Adverserial Networks. In these networks two players: a discriminator and a generator are trained in parallel with opposite goals: the generator wants to produce fakes, that go through as real and the discrimnator wants to detect fakes and reject them. The overall goal is to improve both player, where the focus might be on either of them. 

## Exercise 1: MNIST with a GAN
In this exercise a Gan was build to create fake handwritten digits:
- this is a small project, that does not take much time to train and you can none the less watch how a GAN works and trains
