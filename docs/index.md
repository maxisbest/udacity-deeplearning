# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation
(11.2017 - 04.2018)

## About
This Udacity Nanodegree Foundation is taught by several specialists on Deep Learning and takes you from Neuronal Networks over Convolutional and Recurrent Networks to Reinforcement Learning. It offers a lot of practice and exposure to many projects and tools.

## Course Work
Here you can find the projects and exercises we did in the course. The **projects** were independent work, whereas the **exercises** came with a solution that you would help you in case you got stuck.

### Part 1: Introduction


### Part 2: Neuronal Networks
- **Project**: [my first neural network](Your_first_neural_network.html)

### Part 3: Convolutional Networks
- **Project**: [Dog breed recognising app build with a pretrained CNN](dog_app.html)

### Part 4: Recurrent Networks
- **Project**: [an RNN trained on TV scripts of the Simpsons](dlnd_tv_script_generation.html)
- Exercise

### Part 5: Generative Adverserial Networks
GANs are Generative Adverserial Networks. In these networks two players: a discriminator and a generator are trained in parallel with opposite goals: the generator wants to produce fakes, that go through as real and the discrimnator wants to detect fakes and reject them. The overall goal is to improve both player, where the focus might be on either of them.

### Part 5: Reinforcement Learning
