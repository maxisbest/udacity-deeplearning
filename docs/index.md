# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree

Overview about what we learned:

## Introduction

## Neural Networks

## Convolutional Networks

## Recurrent Networks

## Generative Adversarial Networks

### GANs with MNIST
- [Intro_to_GANs_Exercises](Intro_to_GANs_Exercises.html): A Fake MNIST generator is trained

### Batchnormalization
batch normalization can make NN training a lot more robust for deep networks 
- lesson that compares training with and without batch normalization: [html](Batch_Normalization_Lesson.html) / [notebook](https://github.com/sabinem/udacity_DL/blob/master/batch_normalization/README.md)
