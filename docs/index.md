# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation

Overview about what we learned:

## Introduction
As an introduction we were given some examples of what deep learning is capable of: 
1. Transfering an artist's styles to your own fotographs: [->**Fast Style Transfer**](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer)
2. Learning to steer a car: [->**Deep Traffic**](https://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/)
3. Learning to play flappybird: [->**DeepLearningFlappyBird**](https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird)

### Literature
Here you can find some of the books and articles that got recommended to us during the course:
- [Literature on Deep Learning](literature.md)

### Tools
These tools were introduced to us in the course
- [Anaconda](anaconda.md)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](jupyter_notebooks.md)
- [Numpy](numpy.md)



## Neural Networks

## Convolutional Networks

## Recurrent Networks

## Generative Adversarial Networks

### GANs with MNIST
- [Intro_to_GANs_Exercises](Intro_to_GANs_Exercises.html): A Fake MNIST generator is trained

### Batchnormalization
batch normalization can make NN training a lot more robust for deep networks 
- lesson that compares training with and without batch normalization: [html](Batch_Normalization_Lesson.html) / [notebook](https://github.com/sabinem/udacity_DL/blob/master/batch_normalization/README.md)
