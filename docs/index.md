# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation
(11.2017 - 04.2018)

## About
This Udacity Nanodegree Foundation is taught by several specialists on Deep Learning and takes you from Neuronal Networks over Convolutional and Recurrent Networks to Reinforcement Learning. It offers a lot of practice and exposure to many projects and tools.

## Course Work
Here you can find the projects and exercises we did in the course. The **projects** were independent work, whereas the **exercises** came with a solution that you would help you in case you got stuck.

### Part 1: Introduction
- there was no project in the introduction

### Part 2: Neuronal Networks
- **Project**: [My First Neural Network](Your_first_neural_network.html)

### Part 3: Convolutional Networks
- **Project**: [Dog Breed Recognising App build with a Pretrained CNN](dog_app.html)
- Exercise: [Simple Autoencoder](Simple_Autoencoder.html)
- Exercise: [Convolutional Autoencoder](Convolutional_Autoencoder.html)

### Part 4: Recurrent Networks
- **Project**: [An RNN trained on TV scripts of the Simpsons](dlnd_tv_script_generation.html)

### Part 5: Generative Adverserial Networks
- **Project**: [Face Generator GAN](dlnd_face_generation.html)
